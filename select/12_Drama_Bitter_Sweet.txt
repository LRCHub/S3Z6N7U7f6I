What does it mean when all is lost, but nothing is forgotten?
I'll swallow my grief just so I can walk the other way
I will never be the same

I won't be afraid
If I only have this chance to hold you
But if, if I stay and I only have one chance to hold you
I won't let you go
I won't let you go

What did I do to undress all the beauty that surrounds me?
One look at you will tell me everything I need to hear
There is nothing left to fear

I won't be afraid
If I only have this chance to hold you
But if, if I stay and I only have one chance to hold you
I won't let you go
I won't let you go

Drink up my soul, let me in so you'll know how much I need

I won't be afraid
I know exactly what I have to do
But if, if I stay and I only have this chance to hold you
If I only have this chance to hold you
I won't let go
